## Conway's Game of Life

### Overview: 

An implementation of a visualization of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Haskell.

This was done by implementing tools to for working with discrete lines and discrete 2D spaces using [CodeWorld](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/codeworld-api-0.4.0/docs/CodeWorld.html).

### Usage:

You view the documented code and the final result [here](https://code.world/haskell#P8OOzC2OkQtsgou9WSoNhKA).

You can also experiment with different Oscillators and Spaceships by passing different starting shapes to the `animateConway` method in the `main` method. The code already contains 3 different starting positions: `[blinker, pentaDecathlon, glider]`. You can also define new starting positions by defining the cells in the same manner as the pre-existing starting positions.
